# Classification Challenge

## Overview
This project applies supervised machine learning classification techniques to predict categorical outcomes based on structured data. Using a variety of classification models, it aims to identify the best performing method for the provided dataset. The project was completed as part of a Module 17 machine learning challenge.

## Files
- `classification_challenge.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Resources/` — Directory containing the input dataset.
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions.

## Features
- Data loading, cleaning, and preparation for classification modeling.
- Training multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and others.
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
- Comparison of model performance to identify the optimal model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the required libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lordegraves/classification-challenge.git
cd classification-challenge
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open the `classification_challenge.ipynb` file.
4. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and prepare the dataset.
   - Train multiple classification models.
   - Evaluate and compare model performances.
5. Analyze which model performs best and why.

## Data Sources
- Dataset provided through course materials as part of the machine learning challenge.
